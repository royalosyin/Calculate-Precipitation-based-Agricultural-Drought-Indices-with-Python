# Calculate-Precipitation-based-Agricultural-Drought-Indices-with-Python
Precipitation-based indices are generally considered as the simplest indices because they are calculated solely based on long-term rainfall records that are often available.  The mostly used precipitation-based indices consist of  Decile Index (DI) Hutchinson Drought Severity Index (HDSI) Percen of Normal Index (PNI) Z-Score Index (ZSI) China-Z Index (CZI) Modified China-Z Index (MCZI) Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI) Effective Drought Index (EDI) Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).
